Good afternoon distinguished professors:
	I am glad to be here for this interview.
	
	My name is wangtong, I am a native,living in Chengguanqu. When I graduated from Lanzhou University High School,I was admitted to the Harbin University of Commerce.I major in Information Management and Information System in School of Computer and Information Engineering.

	During my four-year study in the university as an undergraduate student, I have built up a solid foundation of professional knowledge, as well as some experience of extracurricular activities.

	I am open-minded and have broad hobbies such as basketball and jog.In basketball games,there is perfect cooperation ,besides amazing skills.And the reason i am fond of jog is that jog makes me realize the importance of perseverance and controlling rhythm.All of these have a great significance on me,especially when i prepared for the first round of the entrance examination to the Master's degree.

	Although I have a wide range of interests and grasp the essential knowledge of the major,I think at preasent,I should learn deeper to be more professional and competent instead of staying in the superfical level.At the same time,English does matter as well whether in study or entertainment.I have passed the College English Test band 6,but i think it is necessary to prepare for the TOEFL.

	I believe, led by the distinguished professors and scholars here, I’ll go further on computer science and make some achievements in the field. Thank you so much again for giving me the chance for this interview.
